i# Super Mario Brothers Virtualized

This is not a remake. This is the original Super Mario Bros. running on a cycle-accurate, virtualized 6502 CPU, complete with emulated PPU and APU behavior. Built with GTK3+ for configuration and controls and SDL for input and audio‚Äîno video subsystem required‚Äîthis project is a deep-dive into retro hardware emulation with a minimalist GUI.
Core Features

* üß† Fully virtualized 6502 instruction set execution (translated real 6502 instructions into their equivalent C++ instructions then compiled natively)

* üéÆ SDL-driven joystick/gamepad support for up to 2 players (includes keyboard support)

* üîä Low-latency, platform-sensitive audio output (16-bit Windows / 8-bit Linux)

* üñ•Ô∏è GTK3+ interface for launching, configuration, and state feedback

* üß© Modular design for hacking, debugging, or embedding
