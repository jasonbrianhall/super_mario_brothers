# Super Mario Brothers Virtualized

This is not a remake. This is the original Super Mario Bros. running on a virtualized 6502 CPU with emulated PPU and APU behavior. Unlike cycle-accurate emulators, this virtualizer translates 6502 instructions to native code for maximum performance and won't slow down like a real NES when overwhelmed. Available in three versions:

1. **GTK3+/SDL Version**: Built with GTK3+ for configuration and controls and SDL for input and audio, includes Scaling, APU, and PPU caching optimizations
2. **Allegro DOS/Linux Version**: DOS (Allegro 4 only) and Linux (Allegro 4 or 5) with extensive performance caching systems including scaling optimization
3. **Pure SDL**: Built with SDL for input and audio, includes Scaling, APU, and PPU caching optimizations

You do have to provide your own NES ROM (md5sum 811b027eaf99c2def7b933c5208636de)

## Core Features

* üß† Virtualized 6502 instruction set execution (6502 instructions translated to native C++ code, compiled for maximum performance)
* ‚ö° Performance-optimized execution - won't slow down like a real NES when the CPU gets overwhelmed
* üéÆ Joystick/gamepad support (Linux) and keyboard support (both platforms)
* üîä Low-latency, platform-sensitive audio output
* üñ•Ô∏è Cross-platform GUI interface for launching, configuration, and state feedback
* üß© Modular design for hacking, debugging, or embedding
* üöÄ Performance optimizations: APU and PPU caching in both versions, plus scaling cache in Allegro version
* üíæ **Save States**: Complete game state preservation with F5-F8 hotkeys

## Save State System

All versions include a complete save state system that preserves the entire game state:

### üíæ **Complete State Preservation**
- CPU registers and flags
- 2KB system RAM
- Complete PPU state (VRAM, sprite memory, palettes)
- PPU internal registers and scroll positions
- No visual glitches on load - perfect restoration

### üéÆ **Easy Controls**
- **F5-F8**: Save to slots 1-4
- **Shift+F5-F8**: Load from slots 1-4
- Instant save/load with visual feedback
- Cross-platform compatible save files

### üìÅ **File Formats**
- **DOS Version**: SAVE1.SAV, SAVE2.SAV, SAVE3.SAV, SAVE4.SAV (8.3 format)
- **GTK/SDL Versions**: save1.dat, save2.dat, save3.dat, save4.dat
- ~5.5KB per save file (includes complete game state)
- Version checking and corruption detection

## Performance Optimizations

Both versions include core performance optimizations:

### üöÄ **APU Caching System** (Both Versions)
- Caches expensive floating-point operations for audio synthesis
- Pre-calculated waveform tables for all NES audio channels
- Optimized for 8-bit and 16-bit audio output paths

### üé® **PPU Rendering Cache** (Both Versions)
- Sprite caching system with dirty flagging
- Tile pattern cache with automatic invalidation
- Palette lookup optimization for faster color conversion
- 16-bit direct rendering paths for maximum performance

### üñ•Ô∏è  **GTK Additional Features**
- File Menus
- Software Rendering (tearing on MS Windows)
- Rudimentary Cheat Menu

## Allegro DOS/Linux Version - Additional Optimizations

The Allegro version (DOS: Allegro 4, Linux: Allegro 4 or 5) includes all the above optimizations plus:

### üì∫ **Scaling Cache System** (Allegro Version Only)
- Pre-calculated coordinate mapping tables eliminate runtime multiplication
- Optimized 1x, 2x, and 3x scaling paths with unrolled loops
- DOS-specific 320x200 VGA Mode 13h optimization
- Memory-efficient caching reduces CPU overhead by 2-5x

### üñ•Ô∏è **Platform-Specific Features**
- **DOS**: Classic VGA Mode 13h (320x200) support, direct hardware access, keyboard-only input, Allegro 4, unique FM Synthesis audio mode
- **Linux**: F11 fullscreen toggle, multiple resolution support, full joystick/gamepad support, Allegro 4 or 5, FM Synthesis audio mode
- **Both**: Configurable keyboard controls, save/load configurations

## Convert your legally owned NES ROM (YOU MUST LEGALLY OWN THE GAME AND RIP IT YOURSELF)

``` bash
cd source
g++ rom_to_header.cpp -o rom_to_header
./rom_to_header ~/nes/Super\ Mario\ Bros.\ \(JU\)\ \(PRG0\)\ \[\!].nes SMBRom smbRomData
```
Output:
```
Successfully converted ROM file to header and source:
  Input: /home/yourusername/nes/Super Mario Bros. (JU) (PRG0) [!].nes (40976 bytes)
  Output Header: SMBRom.hpp
  Output Source: SMBRom.cpp
  Variable: smbRomData[40976]
```

### Notes about the Converter

This converter translates 6502 assembly code directly to native C++ code for compilation with modern compilers (primarily g++, though it could theoretically work with others). The converter primarily targets the x816 assembly format but includes support for CA65 format as well.

#### Why This ROM Works Well for Virtualization

The Super Mario Bros. ROM is ideal for this conversion approach because it follows straightforward coding patterns:

**‚úÖ What Makes It Compatible:**
- Code executes directly from ROM without self-modification
- Functions have predictable, static jump targets
- No dynamic code generation or execution from RAM
- Uses documented 6502 instructions only

#### Challenging Scenarios (Not Present in SMB)

**üö´ Self-Modifying Code:**
Some games copy code from ROM to RAM and execute it from multiple locations. Virtualizing this would require:
- Dynamic assembly section creation
- Runtime jump target translation
- Complex memory mapping between execution and data access
- Significant engineering effort to maintain proper memory semantics

**üö´ Dynamic Jump Tables:**
Games with computed jumps (like `JMP ($XXXX,X)`) are difficult to translate because:
- Jump targets are calculated at runtime
- Requires lookup tables and case statements in C++
- All possible jump destinations must be pre-analyzed
- Performance overhead from indirect jumps

**üö´ Undocumented Instructions:**
The 6502 has unofficial opcodes that some games exploit:
- Basic implementations exist in the converter
- Untested since SMB doesn't use them
- Could cause compatibility issues with other ROMs

#### Bottom Line

Super Mario Bros. represents the "sweet spot" for 6502-to-C++ conversion - it's sophisticated enough to be interesting but straightforward enough to virtualize efficiently without the engineering complexity that more exotic coding techniques would require.

## Optional: Reconvert the Super Mario 6502 ASM

This code builds the C++ code from smbdis.asm (maybe you found a bug or just want to see how it works):

``` bash
cd converter
python main.py smbdis.asm ../source/SMB/ smb_config/
```

## Build Requirements

### Linux Version
- Allegro 4.x or 5.x development libraries
- GCC/G++ compiler
- Standard Linux development tools

### DOS Version  
- Docker (for cross-compilation)
- Internet connection (build script downloads DJGPP toolchain, Allegro 4 source, and CSDPMI)
- The build process automatically handles all dependencies via `djfdyuruiry/djgpp` Docker image

## Build & Run

### GTK3+/SDL Version (Original)
``` bash
make
cd build/linux
./smbc

make windows
cd build/windows
# Copy all files to Windows and run smbc.exe
```

### Allegro4/5 DOS/Linux Version (Optimized)
``` bash
# Linux build
cd msdos
make
cd build/linux
./smbc

# DOS build from scratch (requires Docker)
cd msdos
./build_from_scratch.sh /work/path/to/your/Super\ Mario\ Bros.nes 
cd build/dos
dosbox smb.exe
```

The DOS version builds in `msdos/build/dos/` and the Linux version builds in `msdos/build/linux/`.
